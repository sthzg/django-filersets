# django-filersets

  ```Status: experimental, currently under development.```

> django-filersets allows users to select a filer directory and display its contents (optionally recrusively) as a set. Each set has meta data like title, description, category, publishing date and publishing status which makes it suitable to act as a thin wrapper around a collection of files.

## Next steps

- Support for a wide array of file types
- A bootstrap based frontend demo
- Different rendering presets
- Easy to extend rendering modes
- High test coverage
- A backend demo
- Support for file/view permissions
